#  Laptop Price Prediction App  

This project is part of our **miniâ€“machine learning project**. The goal was to build a simple web application that can predict the price of a laptop based on its specifications.  

We used **Linear Regression** and some data preprocessing techniques to train a model that understands the relationship between features like RAM, processor, storage, etc., and the laptop price. The app was then deployed using **Streamlit** so anyone can interact with it easily.

##  Project Objectives  
- Collect and prepare a dataset of laptop specifications and prices  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand trends  
- Build a **Linear Regression model** for price prediction  
- Create a **Streamlit web app** for user interaction  
- Deploy the app online for accessibility

##  System Requirements  
- Python 3.9 or above  
- Streamlit  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- Numpy  
- Joblib  

*(All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`)*
